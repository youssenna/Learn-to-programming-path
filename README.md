# Learn-to-programming-path

Welcome to the "Learn-to-programming-path" repository! In this repository, you can see all that I have learned in my path of programming, specifically using C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several steps, each focusing on different levels of programming and problem-solving using C++:

- **Step 1: Introduction to Programming using C++ (Level 1)**
  - This step includes basic projects to get started with C++ programming.
  
- **Step 2: 50 Problem Solving (Level 1) with C++**
  - This step contains 50 problem-solving exercises aimed at beginners.

- **Step 3: 50 Algorithms & Problem Solving (Level 2) using C++**
  - This step focuses on more advanced algorithms and problem-solving exercises.

- **Step 4: Introduction to Programming using C++ (Level 2)**
  - This step includes intermediate-level projects to further enhance programming skills.

- **Step 5: 50 Problem Solving (Level 3) with C++**
  - This step contains 50 advanced problem-solving exercises.

## Projects

Each step contains multiple projects. Below are some examples:

- **Step 1:**
  - Basic C++ programs focusing on syntax and fundamental concepts.
  
- **Step 2:**
  - Problem-solving exercises like loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.
  
- **Step 3:**
  - Advanced algorithms, sorting techniques, and complex problem-solving.
  
- **Step 4:**
  - Intermediate projects including file handling, classes, and objects.
  
- **Step 5:**
  - Advanced problem-solving exercises and algorithm optimization.
